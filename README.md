### DFA/NFA implementation

Here is an implementation of a DFA/NFA for my LFA project. 

It may return all the paths to a final state if the word is accepted, or else will print "Word has not been accepted". 

### Rules:
- The initial state must be the 0 node.
- The alphabet must have just letters.
- Every state must be an int.

### Input file structure:

```
FINAL STATES(i.e 2 3)

NODE1   LETTER    NODE2 (i.e 0 a 1)

NODE1   LETTER    NODE2 (i.e 1 a 2)
```
